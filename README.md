# randhn

A simple bash script that opens HN pages from a random past date.

Tested on MacOS and Linux. On Mac, it uses default browser while on Linux uses Firefox.

By default, it opens one page but may be given a command line argument to open more, max limit 5.

For example:

```
./randhn.sh 2
```
will open 2 HN pages from random past dates.
